The ground based ASOS stations of airports have a historical repository here: ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/

Some quotes from the readme.txt:

"This directory contains ISH/ISD data in directories 
! by year.  
Please note that ISH and ISD refer to the same data--
Integrated Surface Data, sometimes called 
Integrated Surface Hourly."

"The filenames correspond with the station numbers listed in the ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-history.txt file (and in
ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-history.csv )
or http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/

Downloaded the *.csv and put it into the directory.

The stations of interest are:

Downloaded these archived files and put them into the directory.
It looks like the files are binaries produced with the help of
a Fortran program.

However! We now know the names and codes for the stations and their datasets, let's try retrieving the data through the web-service. The token is free (but it should be activated).

NOAA cdo http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/token
 documentation http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2
Token:	NbgcGSTExtVsfjGNSVmUJxsYtRykAPLc

There is a package 'rnoaa' too. MIRACULOUSLY (!!!) it has an "isd_read(path)" function in it that READS THE LOCAL ISD/ISH file!


```{r}
library("rnoaa", lib.loc="~/R/win-library/3.3")
#fle <- system.file("E:/R/R-processing-of-public-datasets/", "725300-94846-2016.gz", package = "rnoaa")
#ohr <- isd_read(fle)
ohr <- isd_read("E:/R/R-processing-of-public-datasets/725300-94846-2016.gz")
```

And it worked. Let's cut all the unnecessary and save what we've got for O'Hare

```{r}
ohr$Hour <-0; ohr$Day <- 0; ohr$Month <- 0
  ohr <- ohr[,c("usaf_station", 
                        "date", "time",
                        "Hour", "Day", "Month", 
                        "temperature", 
                        "temperature_dewpoint",
                        "wind_direction", "wind_speed", 
                        "air_pressure")]

# save(ohr, file = "ohr.rda")
```

For some reason the observations have a 5:59 point every day with all 9-s. Need to remove it from here. Subsetting of course.

```{r}
ohr <- subset(ohr, !time=="0559")

#Then we convert the Measurement.Timestamp to character
#then - to POSIXlt
  
#  ohr$date <- as.character.POSIXt(ohr$date)
  ohr$date <- as.POSIXlt(paste(ohr$date, ohr$time, sep =" "), 
                                 format = "%Y-%m-%d %H%M", tz="")
  
#Now 'time' column can be removed
  ohr$time <- NULL
  
#Let's unify the names a little bit
  
  names(ohr) <- c("Station.Name", "Measurement.Timestamp", 
                  "Hour", "Day", "Month", "Air.Temperature",
                  "Temperature.Dewpoint", "Wind.Direction",
                  "Wind.Speed", "Barometric.Pressure")

## about dates format: http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/dates.html
# fill in the columns Hour Day (day of the year mday for anthr) Month
  
  ohr$Hour <- ohr$Measurement.Timestamp$hour
  ohr$Day <- ohr$Measurement.Timestamp$yday
  ohr$Month <- ohr$Measurement.Timestamp$mon

```

Let's look:

```{r}
library("ggplot2", lib.loc="~/R/win-library/3.3")

qplot(Measurement.Timestamp, Air.Temperature, data = ohr, color = I("magenta"), 
      size = I(.5), alpha = I(1/2))
```

There's are point with 999.9 temperature ( by boxplot(ohr$Air.Temperature) )in April and July, let's find and replace them with a medium between the neighbouring points or just exclude them. 

```{r}
ohr <- ohr[!(ohr$Air.Temperature==999.9),]

qplot(Measurement.Timestamp, Air.Temperature, data = ohr, color = I("magenta"), size = I(.5), alpha = I(1/2))
```

There is a missing value too. Let's exclude it too.

```{r}
ohr <- ohr[!is.na(ohr$Air.Temperature),]
ohr <- ohr[!is.na(ohr$Measurement.Timestamp),]
qplot(Measurement.Timestamp, Air.Temperature, data = ohr, color = I("magenta"), size = I(.5))
```

Now everything is ok. The missing value was in the Measurement.Timestamp, not in the Temperature.

Now let's learn to calculate Humidity from Temperature.Dewpoint and vice versa.

Temperature.Dewpoint = Temperature - (100 - Humidity)/5

temperatures in Celsius. Humidity in %

```{r}

```
