The ground based ASOS stations of airports have a historical repository here: ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/

Some quotes from the readme.txt:

"This directory contains ISH/ISD data in directories 
! by year.  
Please note that ISH and ISD refer to the same data--
Integrated Surface Data, sometimes called 
Integrated Surface Hourly."

"The filenames correspond with the station numbers listed in the ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-history.txt file (and in
ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-history.csv )"

Downloaded the *.csv and put it into the directory.
