This is a simple [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

## Chicago Weather from weather stations

The  URLs for data are on the portal https://data.cityofchicago.org/ 

In particular the hourly data from the three beach weather stations has a Base URL: 
https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/7edu-s3u7.json 
The API documentation for this dataset is at:
https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cityofchicago.org/77jv-5zb8

Let's read the dataset and display the 'head' of it:

```{r}
df <- read.csv("https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/7edu-s3u7.csv")
head(df)

```

Unfortunately the web-service only lets you download 1000 observations in this way and displays the Date/Time with AM/PM which is near impossible to deal with in R.


When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
